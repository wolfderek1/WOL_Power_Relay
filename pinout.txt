Status LEDs (WS2812B Addressable RGB):
--------------------------------------
GPIO 4  -> PC1 Status LED (WS2812B)
        -> LED Data In (DIN)
        -> LED VCC -> 5V (or 3.3V)
        -> LED GND -> GND

GPIO 5  -> PC2 Status LED (WS2812B) 
        -> LED Data In (DIN)
        -> LED VCC -> 5V (or 3.3V)
        -> LED GND -> GND

GPIO 18 -> WiFi Status LED (WS2812B)
        -> LED Data In (DIN)
        -> LED VCC -> 5V (or 3.3V)
        -> LED GND -> GND

Note: Each WS2812B LED is individually addressable
- Can display any RGB color (16.7 million colors)
- Built-in controller chip
- Only requires 1 data pin per LED
- 5V power recommended for best brightness
- 3.3V data signal compatible

Power Control:
-------------
GPIO 2  -> PC2 Relay Control

        -> Relay Module VCC -> 3.3V
        -> Relay Module GND -> GND
        -> Relay NO/NC -> PC Power Switch pins

Power Supply:
------------
ESP32 VIN -> 5V (USB or external)
ESP32 GND -> Ground (common ground with all components)
ESP32 3.3V -> Power for relay module (if 3.3V compatible)
