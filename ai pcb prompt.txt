I need a PCB design for an ESP32 device with a 2.8" ILI9341 touchscreen display. The board should connect an ESP32-WROOM-32 module to the display via SPI. 

Main connections needed:
- ESP32 GPIO23 to display MOSI
- ESP32 GPIO19 to display MISO  
- ESP32 GPIO18 to display SCLK
- ESP32 GPIO15 to display CS
- ESP32 GPIO2 to display DC
- ESP32 GPIO4 to display RST
- ESP32 GPIO21 to touch CS

Include USB-C connector for power and programming with auto-reset circuit. Add a 3.3V regulator (AMS1117) to power everything from 5V USB. The board should be compact, about 60x85mm, with mounting holes in the corners.

Add a power LED and include proper decoupling capacitors near the ESP32. Make it a simple 2-layer board suitable for hobby PCB manufacturing.
